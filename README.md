## Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the zip file.
2. Navigate to directory
3. Run the game: `python main.py`

## How to Play

The objective of the game is to navigate a bird through a series of pipes without hitting them. Press the space bar to make the bird flap its wings and fly upward. The bird will gradually fall down due to gravity, so you need to keep pressing the space bar to keep it flying.

## Difficulty Settings

There are three difficulty settings: 1, 2, 3, and 4. You can select the difficulty setting by clicking on the difficulty settings on the Game Over screen. The current difficulty is shown in the top right corner of the screen.

## High Score

The game keeps track of the highest score achieved by the player for the current run. 

## Antigravity Mode

Antigravity mode is a special mode where gravity is reversed, making the bird fly upwards instead of falling down. You can activate antigravity mode by on 'Antigrav' on the Game Over Screen. To change back to 'normal,' click on normal on the Game Over Screen.

## Sound Effects

The game includes sound effects for the bird flapping its wings, increasing score, and colliding with a pipe.

## Credits

This game is based on the original Flappy Bird game by Dong Nguyen.
